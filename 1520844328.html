Welcome back to your biannual update! A whole lot has happened, as usual. Though, I am getting back into TES3MP scripting and programming. A bit back I had worked on a bunch of scripts and was going to host a server with a friend called "The Skooma Den" but after a beta launch dev started to slow and everyone had left to do more important things. 
 
I'll be developing with a few other people, with all of my work being completely open source & public, and I will try to create a wiki to help new devs get learn about working with tes3mp.
