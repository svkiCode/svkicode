I've had this log running since ~2017-05-09, and both in regards to this, and my own research/projects, have done very little. The intention of this is to sort and provide a log of my thoughts, as well as to help keep myself from stalling or straying off track. 
 
As this is a general log of thoughts, any current goings-on may be discussed here. I suppose if I were to sum up what I hope to do, I would say 'proto-decking', or working towards Shadowrun decking. The improvement of interfacing and instinctive communication between human-machine, alongside intimate knowledge of computer systems. 
 
A tarball of previous logs will be hosted under 'files', in case anyone wants to read them. 
 
Thus far I've used 'svki' when posting, though this may change in the future.
