Alright, so I fell asleep, then proceeded to waste the weekend. 
 
Right now I'm messing around with a 555 VCO circuit, trying to learn about how to generate different waveforms. Reason being that I'm currently in love with the eurorack format, and with no job it is much too expensive for me. 
 
By the way, if there is anyone reading that wants to contact me, there's a scrambled address on the 'about' page.

Somewhat distracted, trying to figure out ALSA surround sound so that I can have more audio outputs 
 
#1507614735 
Got it to work! Created a pcm_slave connected to hw:0, and have multiple pcm plugs connecting it as a dmix slave. 
I'll upload my .asoundrc when I can, I'm not currently hosting this on my personal server, so I can't change settings.

Alright, so I have this elongated LED lamp originally meant for mounting to a car-hood while your working, and I have a couple ideas on what to do with it. 
 
1: Make it dimmable 
2: Allow it to be controlled by a tether 
3: Be able to control the charging circuit 
4: Create a way to mount it places

I admit that I have relatively little electronics knowledge, but here's my initial ideas on how to do it. 
 
1: For the dimming I'll use a 555 timer for PWM, with a DAC to control it. 
2: I can use a 3v relay connected to a flip-flop for control from either a tether or a button. 
3: Not sure 
4: Not sure

Wonderful! I seem to have had my first encounter with the mysterious popping noise. Now if only I could figure out what it came from.

No progress since last update. Attempting to figure out a PWM IC. 
 
#1507802001 
I've gotten sidetracked from my sidetrack. I'm designing a simple VCF sequencer, even though I haven't built a VCO yet.

Working on site updates, expect it within a few hours 
 
#1507879492 
I should have wrote better code... currently relearning how the site generator works.
