The past year I've entirely stalled. I haven't posted, nor have I worked on anything. 
Reasoning behind this boils down to ADHD, alongside other as-of-yet unknown mental-health issues. 
 
I'm entirely confused as to what I'm dealing with, and I've no clue how long it will take to sort out. 
 
In the meantime I'm going to make a large effort to continue working on projects, as well as posting here. 
I can't say I won't stall again, though I truly hope not to. 
 
 
To reiterate, the purpose of this site is that of a personal syslog. 
A place to log projects, collect ideas, and display status. 
 
 
Cautiously spoken, there will soon be a semi-steady flow of logs. 
 
See you soon, 
	-svki
