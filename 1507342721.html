Since the last post, not much progress on anything has happened. 
I wasn't doing the greatest and once again, I let everything fall apart. 
I think I'm good now, and hopefully it won't happen again. 
 
From now on this will be less of a blog, and more of a personal syslog. A readout of projects, ideas, and status, both digital and "analog". 
 
Expect activity
